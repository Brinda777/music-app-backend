## **üìå Project Overview**  
This backend powers the **Madhur Music Recommendation System**, a personalized music recommendation platform designed to enhance the listening experience for users, particularly females aged 18‚Äì23 in Nepal. The system leverages **content-based filtering and item-based collaborative filtering** to recommend songs based on user preferences, listening history, and song attributes such as danceability, energy, and tempo. The backend processes user interactions, manages song data, and ensures efficient recommendation generation.  

## **‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used**  
- **FastAPI** - For building high-performance APIs.  
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database to store user and song data.  
- **Scikit-Learn & NumPy** - For implementing recommendation models.  
- **Spotify API** - Fetching additional metadata like album covers and previews.  
- **Pandas** - For handling large datasets efficiently.  
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure user login and data handling.  

## **üìÇ Project Structure**  
- **`/src`** - Main source code  
  - **`/routes`** - API endpoints for fetching recommendations, user interactions, and song data.  
  - **`/controllers`** - Business logic to handle request processing.  
  - **`/models`** - MongoDB schemas for users, songs, and interactions.  
  - **`/services`** - Core recommendation logic for generating personalized song lists.  
  - **`/config`** - Configuration files (database connections, environment variables, and API keys).  

## **üöÄ Key Features**  
- **Hybrid Recommendation System** - Uses both **content-based filtering** (analyzing song attributes) and **collaborative filtering** (learning from similar users).  
- **Emotion-Based Recommendations** - Suggests songs based on mood-related audio features.  
- **Scalable API** - Built with FastAPI for quick and efficient responses.  
- **Secure Authentication** - Implements JWT-based authentication for user access.  
- **Data Optimization** - Uses memory-efficient data processing techniques.










## **‚ú® Future Improvements**  
- **Optimize recommendation models** for even better accuracy and diversity.  
- **Improve API security** with advanced authentication mechanisms.  
- **Enhance scalability** to handle larger datasets more efficiently.  
- **Introduce real-time feedback loops** to improve personalized recommendations over time.
